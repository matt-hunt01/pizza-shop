This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

CORS Issue:
APIs were giving CORS error. So, we build the app by enabling CORS using the chrome extension 'CORS'.
Error Message: "Access to fetch at 'https://core-graphql.dev.waldo.photos/pizza' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status."

Steps to Run the Project:

1. Extract the folder and move into the folder from the teminal.
2. Run 'npm install' from the terminal to install the dependencies of the app.
3. Run 'npm start'. Runs the app in the development mode.  
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
